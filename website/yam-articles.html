	<h2>Introduction to the German Volume Training</h2>
	<p>GVT, also known as the 10 sets methods, 
	dates back to mid-70’s and originates from Germany. 
	Because of this, I decided to name my variant the German Volume Training. <span id="dots">...</span>
	<span id="more">
	This method was, to the best of Poliquin's knowledge, 
	popularized by Rolf Feser, 
	the German National Weightlifting Coach of that time, 
	and was quite popular in weightlifting circles as a method to gain weight, 
	often causing athletes to move up one full weight class in only 12 weeks.
